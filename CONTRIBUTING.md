I welcome contributions but pull request will _not be considered_ unless:

#### Code 
1) Code is formatted in the general same general style as the rest,
2) Code is readable and names are clear to their purpose (i.e. no a,b,c stuff),
3) Some basic unit testing is implemented at least,
4) Nothing breaks (i.e. regression testing),

#### Documentation
5) New code is documented properly and new header files have a complete 
description at the top (see previous code),
6) Documentation text and diagrams (plantUML) are updated to reflect any
 change that affects them,
7) Doxygen must be able to compile the docs

#### Git commits
8) Commits are per file/dependency chain (see previous commits to get an idea)
9) Commit messages are clear and descriptive starting with the full namespace
 of the addition/change in square brackets

#### Other
10) Any architectural changes need to be discussed prior.

Any questions/clarification just message me.
