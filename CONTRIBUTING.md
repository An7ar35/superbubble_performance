I welcome contributions but pull request will _not be considered_ unless:

#### Code

1. Formatted in the same general style as the rest of the code base,
2. Readable and names are clear to their purpose (i.e. no a,b,c stuff),
3. Some basic unit testing is implemented at least on the more complicated functions,
4. Nothing breaks.

#### Documentation

5. All code is documented properly and new header files have a complete 
description at the top (see previous code),
6. Documentation text and diagrams (plantUML) are updated to reflect any
 change that affects them,
7. Doxygen must be able to compile the docs

#### Git commits

8. Commits are per file/dependency chain (see previous commits to get an idea)
9. Commit messages are clear and descriptive starting with the full namespace
   of the addition/change in square brackets,

#### Other

10. Any architectural changes need to be discussed prior.

Any questions/clarification just message me.
